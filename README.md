## The Medieval Weapons Sound Effects Library

If a weapon is alone on a battlefield, does it still make a sound? Sure can,
and they're here for you.

This bundle has sound effects of all of our melee weapons making violent
contact with every other weapon. These sounds are cut, but minimally mixed.
We recommend a compressor to bring them to the sweet spot.

When warriors of old went to war they hit heavy sharp and hard things together.
So did we, have at it.

Drawing, sheathing, swinging, all at varying speeds. Bows are drawn, knocked,
released. Arrows pass by from several angles. These sounds are cut, but
minimally mixed. Many work as they are, but playing around with them never hurt
anything.

## The Free Firearm Sound Effects Library

Sometimes you need a gunshot and you don't want to mess around with the fine
tuning. Look no further, these sounds are cut and compressed for quick drag and
drop.

This bundle is all about premixed gunshots. Gunshots usually take some work
between recording and use. This bundle is meant to be the happy medium of
universal drag and drop application from our close stereo mics. If you want
your sound to be perfectly catered to your project, work from the raw files.

This is the complete firearm package, just waiting for your signature mixing
skills to brew up some sweet sounds.

No matter your skill level, you'll want this bundle for your next project with
gun sounds. This has all the weapon mechanics, mag loading, and dry firing.
This also has the full mic setup for gunshots, behind, near, and far. These
files are cut, but totally unmixed to grant you total control of these sounds.
